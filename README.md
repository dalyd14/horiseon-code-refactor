# Code Refactor Starter Code
This repository was weekly assignment 01. Our task was to take already established html and css
landing page code and refactor them for accessibility purposes.

Administrative Changes
First:  Renamed repository name to "horiseon-code-refactor"
Second: Changed file structure from having "Develop" as a parent folder 
		to having the index.html and Assets folder in the main branch.
		I did this so GitHub Pages can access to index.html file in the main branch.
