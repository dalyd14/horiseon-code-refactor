# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Purpose
This repository was weekly assignment 01. Our task was to take already established html and css
landing page code and refactor them for accessibility purposes.

## Administrative Changes
1. Renamed repository name to "horiseon-code-refactor"
1. Changed file structure from having "Develop" as a parent folder 
	to having the index.html and Assets folder in the main branch.
	I did this so GitHub Pages can access to index.html file in the main branch.
